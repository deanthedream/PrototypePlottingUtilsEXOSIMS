# Excellent solution to high order quadratics with unknown solutions.
1. determine the maximum order that the trig functions can have
2. ensure they are quasi independent.
3. Take a number of sample datapoints
4. solve system of euqations for coefficient values. Or solve as eigenvalue problem
5. The solutions to this eigen value problem should be the polynomial term inn the sv-sv visibility about earth equations.

6. plug solutions back in to original equations to ensure the values are correct.
