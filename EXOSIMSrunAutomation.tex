\section{makeSimilarScripts.py}
This script is designed to be run from the 'EXOSIMS/Scripts' folder.
The template script scriptAAA.json must be located in the 'EXOSIMS/script' folder.
\paragraph{Inputs:}
makeSimilarInst.json - this file is located in the run directory and encodes the instructions for making a set of similar json input scripts.
scriptAAA.json
\paragraph{Outputs:}
queueXXX.json - this file is a queue containing a list of all

\subsection{makeSimilarInst.json}
Every configuration of this script has keys
'sweepType' and 'sweepParameters'.
The 'sweepType' field must be a string.
'sweepType' has valid input fields of "SweepParameters" and "SweepParametersPercentages".
The 'sweepParameters' field must be a list of strings where each string is a valid key of the EXOSIMS json script.

\subsubsection{SweepParameters}
The 'sweepType' "SweepParameters" is designed to sweep any set of parameters in 'sweepParameters' key.
The makeSimilarInst.json must have the 'sweepValues' key.
The 'sweepValues' key must have the same length as the 'sweepParameters' key.
i.e. 'sweepParameters':[param1, param2, ..., paramn] and 'sweepValues':[vals1, vals2, ..., valsn] where the length of both lists are n
Each valsi in 'sweepValues' is a list of values.
Each list valsi in 'sweepValues' has the same length.
The number of executable EXOSIMS created has length len(valsi).

\subsubsection{SweepParametersPercentages}
The 'sweepType' "SweepParametersPercentages" is designed to take a set of parameters and set of percentages and run percentage based sweeps on single and combinations of parameters.
This 'sweepType' requires a 'sweepPercentages', 'sweepParameters', and 'sweepCombNums'.

\paragraph{The 'sweepCombNums'} are a list of sweep combination lengths (i.e. sweepCombNums = [1] means each parameter).
\paragraph{The 'sweepPercentages'} are a list of percentages   where XX\% is 0.XX and -XX\% is -0.XX. 
The list must contain at least 1 element but may contain an arbitrarily large number of elements.
No element may contain less than or equal to -100\%.
\paragraph{The 'sweepParameters'} can be any number of parameters, but all parameters will be varied by the same percentage.

%\subsubsection{SweepParametersUniquePercentages}
%The 'sweepType' "SweepParametersUniquePercentages" is designed to take a set of parameters  percentages and run percentage based sweeps on single and combinations of parameters.


\section{runQueue}
\paragraph{Inputs:}
outpath (string) - this is the full filepath to the "output directory". This "output directory" is the location that each "job" directory will be saved. A "job" is a specific json script which is executed over a number of runs (numRuns).
queue.json (file) - see \ref{queue.json)
\paragraph{Outputs:}


\section{queue.json}\label{sec:queue.json}
This file is located in the "EXOSIMS/run" directory.
This json file encodes the "scriptNames" and "numRuns".
"scriptNames" is a list of strings where each string is a filename of a file that exists in the "EXOSIMS/Scripts" folder.
"numRuns" is a list of integers with same length as "scriptNames" where each number of runs is the number of runs to execute for the corresponding script name.



This is time for all good men to come to the aid of their party!

\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

\section{Previous work}\label{previous work}
A much longer \LaTeXe{} example was written by Gil~\cite{Gil:02}.

\section{Results}\label{results}
In this section we describe the results.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.
